# node-breaktime

This is a basic node app you can run from your terminal

It will open a tab in your browser and play a video to remind you to stand and walk around periodically. 
You can set which video and the period of time

Clone this repo to a folder in your computer and cd into that folder

run 'npm install' on your terminal to install the dependencies

(change the video or the time you want between breaks)

run 'npm start' to start the app
